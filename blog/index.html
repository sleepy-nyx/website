      <p>i have been feeling rather lost lately. it's hard for me to pin point exactly how i feel or why i feel that
        way since neither my brain nor my body likes communicating with me<sup class="note" title="or i am very bad
          at understanding them">[1]</sup> but thinking about the world feels crushing. it's like the more i learn
        about how our society is structured the more absurd it feels and it makes me feel almost dissociative. it feels
        like the whole world is built exactly the way i think it should <em>not</em> be!</p>

      <h1 id="identifying-the-problems">identifying the problems</h1>
      <h2 id="what-we-could-have">what we could have</h2>
      <p>i think it's important that both you and me know what i'm actually talking about to make this entire
        topic tangible. the reality how i see it is: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>we are many humans and we need to feed and house us all and we need to keep ourselves clean etc (our
          material needs)</li>
        <li>we have developed technologies (esp. in agriculture and general means of getting resources, energy and
          construction/production) that make our means of production incredibly efficient. this means we need only a
          fraction of the work able to be put out by a group of people to have all their material needs met.</li>
        <li>all of this can be done in humane and sustainable ways. meaning we don't have to destroy the planet or
          rely on slavery to meet everyone's material needs. renewable energy (esp. solar) is cheaper and more
          efficient in every way (including resources, recycling, production, space, even including batteries) than
          fossil fuels. material science makes a breakthrough every other day^[disclaimer: this is a hyperbole] allowing
          more efficient and sustainable housing etc. railways can connect us at incredible speeds and can rely
          completely on green energy. etc etc etc<sup class="note"
            title="no i do not have any sources for this atm but that would indeed be a topic worth looking for scientific research">[2]</sup>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="however-">however,</h2>
      <p>we still live in a world full of suffering due to unmet material needs. and this is not just on a small scale,
        it's literally billions of people who are being denied access to food, water, shelter, hospitals etc. and
        this extends across the entire globe. not just the global south, which is usually the first victim of western
        imperialism and capitalism, is suffering, but the west, too. more and more.</p>
      <h1
        id="if-we-have-the-ability-to-make-good-lives-for-everyone-at-a-fraction-of-the-work-we-are-currently-putting-out-right-now-then-why-aren-t-we-">
        if we have the ability to make good lives for everyone at a fraction of the work we are currently putting out
        right now, then why aren't we?</h1>
      <p>obviously it comes down to imperialism, capitalism, patriarchy and the state.
        all of these serve to justify inequality and suffering.</p>
      <h2 id="why-i-think-so">why i think so</h2>
      <p>i like to think of it by comparing it to monarchies or similar obviously unjust systems. in a monarchy, the
        monarch may justify their power through religion or their family tree or whatever. this then means that this
        monarch stands above all the other people in the kingdom. from a modern lens it is easy to see how monarchies
        are oppressive systems that hurt most people for the profit of the few. but i think most people were quite
        contempt living under monarchy. yet from an outsider perspective it's easy to tell how it only serves as a
        system to enforce inequality to profit the few while the many have to suffer.
        if we now take our modern liberal<sup class="note" title="tw: nuance">[4]</sup> democracies you may think we
        have abolished the issues that
        monarchies or other dictatorial or tyrannical systems bring for most of their population.</p>
      <h2 id="yet-we-still-have-all-these-issues-in-society-despite-having-all-the-tools-to-get-rid-of-them">yet we
        still have all these issues in society despite having all the tools to get rid of them</h2>
      <p>this is because we still have an upper class that profits unjustly from the masses. and the difference between
        the wealth of the many and the few has gotten incomprehensibly larger since we abolished the monarchies.
        the issue is that people are still content enough with these systems<sup class="note"
          title="i also have a lot of thoughts on why this might be the case. perhaps i will make a post on that some day">[5]</sup>.
        of course, as material conditions worsen and worsen, more and more people criticize it. yet the ways in which
        our current systems of power justify their power have developed to a point where it requires a lot of work to
        argue why the power is still unjust<sup class="note" title="i think all power is unjust">[6]</sup></p>
      <h1 id="all-power-is-used-to-profit-those-in-power">all power is used to profit those in power</h1>
      <p>and this becomes more and more evident as we see people in positions of power gain more power and riches. we
        can see the people using these systems of power (capitalism, imperialism, patriarchy and the state) for their
        own profit and to enforce even stricter hierarchies as they keep coming up with new ways to justify their
        suppression.
        examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the rise of surveillance on the internet to 'protect children'</li>
        <li>more power to the police to 'protect the people'</li>
        <li>'investing' in 'third world countries' to 'help them', when in reality they are only
          bringing them into <em>their</em> consumer market and under <em>their</em> control and making them dependent
          on <em>them</em>. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>i could go on criticizing almost every large scale operation under the gist to 'help' but that's
        not the point of this post.</p>
      <p><strong>the point is to gather how we can continue to live in this cruel world</strong></p>

      <hr>

      <h1 id="what-can-we-do-">what can we do?</h1>
      <p>this is the real point of this post. i want to share and gather how we can continue to live despite these
        issues. and i think the way we avoid falling into despair is by starting small, in our everyday lives. not only
        because that is the place where all of us are definitely able to make change, but also because it is the
        prerequisite for larger, systematic change</p>
      <h1 id="community">community</h1>
      <p>i think the most important thing we can do is have community. to help out each other through direct action and
        <strong>free ourselves from the expectation of direct reciprocation</strong> that has been so normalized through
        capitalism and the bunch.
        humans aren't social because we expect to benefit from it. we are social because we just are. helping each
        other is the basis of all human life. profiting from helping others is just the consequence in the second step,
        a nice cherry on top, but this sort of egoistic motivation can't be used to drive every human action
      </p>
      <h2 id="but-how-">but how?</h2>
      <p>however, how we can do this practically in every day life is a question that can seem difficult to approach.
      </p>
      <h3 id="mindset">mindset</h3>
      <p>i think the first step is this mindset. to help without any expectation to gain anything from it<sup
          class="note" title="of course this does not mean that you should let yourself be selfishly exploited by others, i think that goes without
        saying">[7]</sup>. the idea is to let go of the mindset to only do things if you gain something from doing
        them. and on
        first thought it's easy to think you're already doing so, and you might in fact be, but the grip of
        imperialism, capitalism and patriarchy run so so much deeper than anyone thinks</p>
      <h3 id="direct-action">direct action</h3>
      <p>direct action is another extremely important building stone of better communities. instead of going through
        imperialistic bureaucracy that slows things down to help, you can just help! illustrative example: if
        there's a city that needs water you can either make petitions and talk to politicians to hopefully, some
        day, get a well built. or you can build a well!<sup class="note"
          title="obviously a simplification, yet our societies do over-complicate processes unnecessarily in order to further centralize power">[8]</sup>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="closing-thoughts">closing thoughts</h2>
      <p>as mentioned, i am also looking for help with this. so i am sending this off with a few questions to ponder
        that might help make the world ever so slightly better for the people living in it</p>
      <ul>
        <li>do you have any tips that can make living together more human and based on mutual help?</li>
        <li>what are things you do or that can be done in every day life that you do simply to help someone out, because
          you understand that we are humans and as such need each other?</li>
        <li>any examples where direct action helped people even though the general mindset is to keep a distance from
          the problem and only help through indirect action?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>i don't expect these questions to be answered directly, more so to hopefully help be conscious of our
        agency.</p>
